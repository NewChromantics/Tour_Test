Its generous architectural form created a suitably imposing first impression of the State Apartments. During the social season, debutantes and members of the aristocracy ascended this staircase in court dress on their way to attend balls, dinners and presentation ceremonies given by the Viceroy. \nSince 1938, it has been part of the main ceremonial route used during the inauguration of the President of Ireland in the State Apartments."

It provided access to a series of formal State reception rooms overlooking the main courtyard, as well as to the quarters of the Viceroy and his family overlooking the Castle gardens. At its far end, it led to the Privy Council Chamber. It was to this room that each new Viceroy processed when being sworn into office. On 16 January 1922, the Privy Council Chamber was the setting for the handover of Dublin Castle from the last Viceroy to Michael Collins and the new government of the Irish Free State.",

Today the rooms are used as gallery spaces for a vibrant programme of exhibitions, many of which explore themes relating to the Castleâ€™s history.",

These defences take the form of a stone covered embankment, a section of which has been preserved within the massive circular walls of the thirteenth-century Powder Tower.\n\nVisible to visitors is a section of the Castle’s medieval curtain wall with a postern gate and a set of steps that led down to the original moat. The River Poddle, which still flows under the Castle grounds today, would have been diverted in order to create a moat that surrounded the Castle. Other medieval features on the site include part of the early town wall with an archway that allowed the moat to pass under it (blocked up c.1400)."

			"AboutText": "Erected in the early thirteenth century on the site of a Viking settlement, Dublin Castle served for centuries as the headquarters of English, and later British, administration in Ireland. In 1922, following Irelandâ€™s independence, Dublin Castle was handed over to the new Irish government. It is now a major government complex and a key tourist attraction. We hope you enjoy your visit."
