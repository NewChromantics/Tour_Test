Dating from 1204-28, it was largely constructed during the reign of Henry III (1207–72), King of England and Lord of Ireland. Its walls are up to 4.8 metres thick.\n\nIn 1811 the tower was converted to hold state papers, at which time it was revamped to complement the new Chapel Royal being constructed next to it. The height of the tower was raised and its parapet was capped with new masonry battlements.\n\nLike all the early buildings of the Castle, it has had a variety of functions over the centuries. In its early use as the king’s Wardrobe Tower, armour, clothes and the king’s treasure were stored there.\n"
